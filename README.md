# brainscan

**This project was AI-generated using a variety of tools and resources, including manually coded scaffolding for the AI.**

A brain.js neural network that scans the vulnerability risk of your web project's source files. No build step, no bundler — just Node.js and a vanilla HTTP server.

## Getting Started

```bash
node index.js
# → http://localhost:8000
```

No `npm install` required. The only dependency (brain.js) is vendored in `vendor/`.

On first run the network trains from scratch (~20s) and saves a snapshot to `data/trained-network.json`. Subsequent starts load the snapshot instantly.

## How It Works

1. **Open** `http://localhost:8000` and click **Start Scanning**.
2. **Select a file** from the project file browser — the server reads it from disk and runs it through the neural network.
3. **Results** show a risk score (0–100%), a label (Low / Medium / High / Critical), and a breakdown of detected patterns.
4. Click **Retrain NN** to force a full retrain and overwrite the snapshot.

## Detected Patterns

| Feature                                 | Vulnerability                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `eval()`                                | Arbitrary code execution      |
| `.innerHTML =`                          | DOM-based XSS                 |
| `document.write()`                      | Legacy XSS vector             |
| SQL keywords                            | SQL injection                 |
| `exec()` / `spawn()`                    | OS command injection          |
| `req.body` / `req.query` / `req.params` | Unvalidated user input        |
| Dynamic `require()` / `import()`        | Supply-chain / code injection |
| HTTP request patterns                   | SSRF                          |

## Security Notes

- File access is restricted to the project root (path traversal protection).
- Request bodies are capped at 50 KB.
- Only `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, and `.json` files are scannable.
- The GPU backend of brain.js is intentionally excluded; the vendored copy uses CPU-only inference, avoiding native compilation (`node-gyp`/`gl`).
